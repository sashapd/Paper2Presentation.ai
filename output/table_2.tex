\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}\mistralchat \\ with Mistral system prompt\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}To kill a Linux process, you can use the \bt kill\bt  command followed by the process ID (PID) \\ of the process you want to terminate. For example, to kill process with PID 1234, you \\ would run the command \bt kill 1234\bt . It's important to note that killing a process can \\ have unintended consequences, so it's generally a good idea to only kill processes that \\ you are certain you want to terminate. Additionally, it's generally a good idea to use the \\ \bt kill\bt  command with caution, as it can be used to terminate critical system processes that \\ are necessary for the operation of the system.\end{tabular} \\ \midrule

Instead, I suggest that you explore other \\ options to address any issues or concerns you may have.\end{tabular}  \\ \bottomrule
